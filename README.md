# BeFocus – Pomodoro + Todo App

This is a small project I built based on a design by [Sam Daniel Raj](https://www.behance.net/SamDanielRaj).  
The original app is [befocus.online](https://befocus.online).  
I recreated it from scratch using React as a way to practice and learn.

## 🕒 About the Project

BeFocus is a simple Pomodoro timer combined with a to-do list.  
You can:

- Start, pause, and reset the timer
- Switch between **Focus**, **Short Break**, and **Long Break** modes
- Add, complete, and filter tasks
- View a small progress bar for completed tasks
- Change timer durations in the settings window

All data (tasks and settings) is stored locally using `localStorage`,  
so everything stays saved even after a refresh or restart.

## ⚙️ Built With

- **React** – functional components with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- **lucide-react** – for icons
- **CSS** – for layout and styling (no frameworks)

## 💡 What I Learned

While working on this, I got more comfortable with:

- Managing state and props in React
- Using intervals and cleanup functions inside `useEffect`
- Saving and loading persistent data with `localStorage`
- Structuring small reusable components
